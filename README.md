## Internation Debt Statistics
Syntax used: SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, ROUND, DISTINCT, COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT

## Overview
This project allowed me to practice my knowledge on SQL aggregation operators. Debt consisted of multiple different indicators (types of debt) and various countries. Finding the sum of debt by grouping it by either indicator and/or country allowed further insights to the data. Additionally, it made the data easier to understand and easier to read, espeically when the ROUND operator was applied. 

## Insights
This project showed me the power of aggregations while being paired with the GROUP BY operator. I knew that aggregations could not be performed without the GROUP BY function, but this project allowed me to realize why.
